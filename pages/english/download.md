### Environments
{: .doc-sec2 }

Supports Windows 10. Windows 8.1 or previous OS, and 32bit edition might not work.

For the optional devices:

Microphone: Lipsync (viseme) supports physical micrphone and also virtual input. You can use voice changer output as lipsync input.

Web camera: Should layout to your whole face. No high resolution needed, as VMagicMirror use face image with low resolution (320 x 240).

Gamepad: Support XInput style gamepad. XBox controller is a popular one supported.

VMagicMirror requires few for the CPU and GPU specs, but it maybe better for the middle-end PC to concern the CPU usage.

At v0.9.8, there are a few known issue.

issue1: Old AMD CPU may crash the program on startup.
