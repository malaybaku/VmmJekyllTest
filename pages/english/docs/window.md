#### NOTE: Schedule of virtual camera feature removal (v1.6.0)

`Window` tab also supports [Virtual Camera](../tips/virtual_camera) feature, but this function will be removed in v1.6.0.

This is because OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/download) has introduced virtual camera by standard, from version 26.0.

If you want to use VMagicMirror with virtual camera, please consider installing `OBS Studio`.
