# Window

`Window` tab supports BG color when the character window is not transparent, and also can toggle whether the window is always foreground or not.

`Character Transparency Support` can customize when your character is semitransparent and when is opaque.

In default, the character becomes semitransparent during the mouse pointer is onto the character, so that you character does not disturb what exist behind her/him. You can also change the condition by changing sliding `Transparency Level`. For example, level 0 means always NOT transparent, which is older version's behavior.

**Hint:** When you lost where the character is, then turning off `Transparent Window` and pressing `Reset Character Position` might be a help.
