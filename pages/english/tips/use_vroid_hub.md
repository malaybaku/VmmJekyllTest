# Tips: Use VRoid Hub Avatar

VMagicMirror supports VRoid Hub model load from v1.0.0.

This feature makes easy to use several avatars, but you should be careful to some points.

#### Avatar Restriction
{: .doc-sec2 }

VMagicMirror is registered to collaborate with VMagicMirror with some restrictions. Following are the examples.

* VMagicMirror cannot use the avatar whose `Avatar Use` is set to `No`, because VMagicMirror contains many features for streaming as an avatar.

* VMagicMirror cannot use `Attribution: Necessary` models because the software itself does not support the feature.

While VRoid Hub collaboration have those limitations, you can still use those models when the model can be downloaded as a file and you comply the condition of use.
