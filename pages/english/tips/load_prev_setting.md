# Tips: Load Previous Version (> v0.8.0) Setting 

*This feature is available from v0.8.1 or later.

If you have used VMagicMirror v0.8.0 or later, and replace it to newer version, then you can transport older version's setting to newer one.

* Start newer version VMagicMirror.
* On the right side of the control panel, press `Load from Prev ver.` and select older version `VMagicMirror.exe`, then character, layout etc. are transported.

*Window position and size might not be fixed. In this case, adjust it by turning off  `Streaming` tab > `Transparent Window`.
