### 1. Start and Load Character
{: .doc-sec1 }

Start `VMagicMirror.exe` to show GUI window ("Control Panel"), and Green window to show character ("Character Window").

When you close one of the window, the other window also closes and VMagicMirror quits. If you do not want to show control panel, then minimize it.

Click `Load VRM` button on `Home` tab in control panel to select your `.vrm` file on PC.

<div class="row">
{% include docimg.html file="./images/get_started/img00_015_started.png" customclass="col s12 m6" imgclass="fit-doc-img" %}
{% include docimg.html file="./images/get_started/img00_020_load_vrm.png" customclass="col s12 m6" imgclass="fit-doc-img" %}
</div>

After select the character you will see the license for the model. Confirm it and click `OK` to load character.

If you want to load the character automatically on next boot, then check `Load current VRM on next startup`.

<div class="row">
{% include docimg.html file="./images/get_started/img00_030_load_vrm_confirmation.png" customclass="col s12 m6" imgclass="fit-doc-img" %}
{% include docimg.html file="./images/get_started/img00_040_after_loaded.png" customclass="col s12 m6" imgclass="fit-doc-img" %}
</div>

**Hint:** If your character is not shown correctly, try `Adjust size by VRM` button. You can more chances to fix the layout later.

{% include docimg.html file="./images/get_started/img00_160_not_good_layout_example.png" customclass="col s12 m6" imgclass="fit-doc-img" %}
